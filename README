Prototype of independent "workspace" switching for 2 displays:

 - uses XGrabKey to catch shortcuts (ctrl+f1..4, win+1..4, win+tab)
 - uses native workspaces, cuts them by displays and moves windows
 - workspace 0 is always active(!), 4 other workspaces are for saving windows

Implemented commands:

 - set_loaded: set current loaded workspaces (restore after crash)
 - switch: independent switching for 2 displays
 - swap: swap windows on current native workspace between displays
 - swap_displays: swap any combination of display/workspace

More features:

 - tries to restore window focus after switching
 - retains workspace and window focus status between exits/crashes
