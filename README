Prototype of independent "workspace" switching for 2 displays:
 - uses XGrabKey to catch shortcuts (ctrl+f1..4, win+1..4, win+tab)
 - workspace 0 is always active(!), 4 other workspaces are for saving windows
 - mode "part" (default):
   - uses native workspaces, moves windows to display 0 when switching
     (workspaces are shared for both displays)
   - when disconnecting output, only windows on active workspace will be moved
     by window manager
   - (N-1) independent workspaces
 - mode "full":
   - uses native workspaces, cuts them by displays and moves windows
   - you can swap windows between active workspaces
   - (N-1)*2 independent workspaces

Implemented commands:

 - set_loaded: set current loaded workspaces (restore after crash)
 - switch: independent switching for 2 displays
 - swap: swap windows on current native workspace between displays
 - swap_displays: swap any combination of display/workspace
 - clear: unload/load right desktop to allow turning off secondary display

More features:

 - tries to restore window focus after switching
 - retains workspace and window focus status between exits/crashes
